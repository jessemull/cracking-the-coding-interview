Why use Google Cloud?
1. Skaffold / kubernetes were developed at Google!
2. Add additional configuration for Skaffold to tell it to use Google Cloud.
3. We can have Skaffold check synced and unsynced files.
4. When we changed a synced file Skaffold reaches up to Google Cloud and tells the pod to refresh that file and rebuild.
5. When we make a change to an unsynced file, it isn't automatically injected into a pod. Instead, we need to completely rebuild our auth image. 
   (a) By default, anything not listed in the sync section is monitored as unsynced.
   (b) Skaffold will tell Google Cloud to rebuild our image for us.
6. Using Google Cloud will speed up development speed even if we don't deploy via Google Cloud. 
   (a) Rebuilding images, restarting deployments etc will be done in seconds.
7. We will use Google Cloud Build tool to rebuild our images / deployments.
