What are the strategies for sharing code between services?
1. We can just copy/paste.
   (a) Prone to errors.
   (b) Need to update all copied/pasted code one by one each time we need to make an update.
2. We can create a git sub-module.
   (a) A sub-module is a git repository inside another git repository.
   (b) Common code is inside version control.
   (c) Solid documentation about changes made.
   (d) Difficult to configure.
3. Publish code as npm packages.
   (a) Just install as an npm dependency.
   (b) Versioned in common library.
   (c) Solid documentation about changes made.

How do NPM registries work?
1. We can publish to a public registry.
   (a) Anyone can view the code.
2. We can publish it to an organization.
   (a) Can mark this organization as private.
   (b) Only members of the organization can view the code.
3. We can publish it to a private registry.
   (a) Only people who have access to the registry can view the code.
4. Private organizations and registries require paying NPM.
