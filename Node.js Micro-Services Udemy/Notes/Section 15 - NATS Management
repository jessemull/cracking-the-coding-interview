What happens if we save a record to our database but we don't publish an event?
1. This puts our system out of sync.
2. To ensure this doesn't happen, we should save the event into our database and mark it as unpublished.
3. Once publishing is successful we mark the record as published.
4. If we save the event but not the record, we need to roll back the event.
5. If we save the record but not the event, we need to roll back the record.
6. We should use a database transaction that stores both the event and the record at the same time and rolls back both if one doesn't save.
   (a) Most databases just support this transaction functionality out-of-the-box.
7. This course will not cover implementing this rollback or saving the event and marking it as published.
