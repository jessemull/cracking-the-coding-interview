Why do we need response normalization?
1. Client should know the expected structure of things like errors.

How do we normalize validation?
1. We have different errors in different places that can occur during a single call.
2. We need one identical structure that works for anything that goes wrong inside the application.
3. E.g. error could occur because of short password, username already taken or a fail to write to the database.
4. Synchronous route handlers in express handle errors automatically.
5. In asynchronous route handlers we need to capture the error and pass it using next to the next middleware.
6. Writing error handling middleware for express:
   (a) Middleware automatically checks the number of arguments.
   (b) Use err, req, res, next arguments for error handling middleware.
   (c) Error handling middleware will capture all errors and then return a normalized error response.
   (d) Extend the error class in Javascript and add custom properties.
   (e) To do this create an abstract class with a way to serialize the error into a standard format and a status code.
   (f) Then when the middleware sees the error, just grab the status code and call serialized to send the response.
7. Add express-async-errors to make sure async functions handle errors without returning a promise.
