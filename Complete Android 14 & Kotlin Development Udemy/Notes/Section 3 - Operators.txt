What are the Kotlin operands?
1. + -> addition -> sums two numbers.
2. - -> subtraction -> subtracts one number from another.
3. * -> multiplication -> multiplies two numbers together.
4. / -> division -> divides one number into another.
5. % -> modulus -> divides one number into another and returns the remainder.

What if two different types are used?
1. If a floating point type is used with a whole number type the result will be a floating point type e.g. double to handle the precision.
2. The type with the most precision will be used to do the calculation e.g. float + double will result in a double.

How does order of operations work?
1. Use parentheses to guarantee the order of operations, otherwise mathematical rules apply e.g. multiplication before addition.

What are compound assignment operators?
1. Can use shorthand notation e.g. to add two to a number -> myVariable += 2 or to divide by two -> myVariable /= 2.
2. Can use shortcut in IntelliJ to convert into compound assignment operator.

How do we increment and decrement numbers?
1. Prefix incrementation -> ++myVariable.
   (a) Increments the value before output.
2. Postfix incrementation -> myVariable++.
   (a) First outputs the variable and then increments it.
3. Prefix decrementation -> --myVariable.
   (a) Decrements the value before output.
4. Postfix decrementation -> myVariable--.
   (a) First outputs the variable and then decrements it.

How do we add comments in Kotlin?
1. We can use an inline comment using //.
   
   // Here is a single line comment.

2. Can use a multi-line comment using /* */.

   /*

   Here is a multi-line comment.

   */
