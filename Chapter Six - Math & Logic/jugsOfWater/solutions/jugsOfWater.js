// Is this the Die Hard with A Vengeance question? This chapter is truly garbage. We have 5 quart jug and a three quart 
// jug and we need four quarts of water.
//
// This is crazy because I remember the answer due to Die Hard. Do people actually get better at these doing them regularly?
//
// 1. Add three quarts to the five quart jug.
// 2. Fill up three quart jug again and then pour until the five quart jug is full.
// 3. The remainder in the jug is one quart. 5 - 3 = 2, 3 - 2 = 1.
// 4. Now pour out the five quart jug's contents and replace it with the one quart.
// 5. Fill up the three quart jug again and then add that to the five quart jug.
// 6. Now we have four quarts because 1 + 3 = 4.
// 
// Yippee-ki-yay!
